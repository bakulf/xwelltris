                  XWelltris Project - tetris like game
==============================================================================

1. Installation from source tarball (xwelltris-version.src.tar.gz):

First of all you need to unpack tarball, use this command :

   gunzip -c xwelltris-version.src.tar.gz | tar xvf -

After that you can see directory named 'xwelltris-version', change your 
current dir to it:

   cd xwelltris-version

Then you need to configure and make the game:

   ./configure
   make

The default installation path is in /usr/bin and /usr/share/xwelltris dirs.
If you want to install to another dirs, for example in your home subdirs,
you need to say about this in configure:

   ./configure --prefix=/home/user
   make

After make is done with no errors, then install the game:

   make install

Be sure that your $prefix/bin directory is in your $PATH environment variable.

That's all, now you can enjoy the game by typing:

   xwelltris

P.S: XWelltris is the X Window game so it needs Xlibs and X headers to compile
Be shure that you have it installed.

==============================================================================

2. Installation from binaries tarball.

You need to gain root account, then change you dir to '/':

   cd /
   gunzip -c /dir_of_xwelltris_tarball/xwelltris-version.tar.gz | tar xvf -

That's it!

Now type 'xwelltris' under X Window for playing.

P.S: If You like xwelltris, please, send me a letter with names of 
country and city where you are playing the game. It's for my collection.
